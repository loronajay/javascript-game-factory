  // the AI could not be pointed at a second building. The graph says the same thing as data — the

  // enters the graph at the closest waypoint it can actually walk straight to. Without it the
  // nearest waypoint by distance can be one on the other side of a wall — the doorway of the shop
  // next door, the hall stop across a storefront — and the first leg of every route is then a line
