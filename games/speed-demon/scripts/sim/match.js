// Head-to-head match rules — pure, and deliberately **import-free**.
//
// A match is a best-of-N of rounds; a round is one run down the strip, which may
// have to be re-run because somebody jumped the light. This module owns both
// layers and nothing else: it never sees a car, a track or a socket, only who
// fouled, who finished and when.
//
// **Zero imports is a design constraint, not an accident.** The server has to
// adjudicate the match, and the two repos are independent — shared logic is
// mirrored as a `.mjs` copy rather than imported across the boundary (the
// circuit-siege pattern). Keeping this file free of imports is what makes that
// port a rename instead of a rewrite. Do not reach for `constants.js` here.
//
// Two rules decide almost everything:
//
//   **A red light ends the round at green.** The race does not run. On a drag
//   strip the red bulb lights before the cars have left, and the run is over
//   before it started — so the tree is adjudicated the moment it goes green and
//   the round either restarts or is forfeit. This is also why fouls are
//   collected across the whole countdown rather than resolved the instant the
//   first one happens: both drivers can jump the same tree, and the rule for
//   that case (below) needs to know about both of them.
//
//   **The grace fault resets every round.** Each round is its own contest: two
//   red lights *in the same round* forfeit it, and the counter zeroes when the
//   next round starts. A driver who reds once a round all match is never
//   escalated against — the cost of a red light is the round it happened in,
//   not a debt carried into the next one.
