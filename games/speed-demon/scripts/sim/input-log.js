// The canonical record of what a driver did, and the machinery to replay it.
//
// PURE. This is the module online play is actually built on, and it exists
// because of a property `race.js` already had: every mutation there is a
// function returning a fresh race, with no clock and no randomness anywhere in
// `sim/`. A run is therefore *entirely* determined by its options plus the
// inputs that were made, and nothing else — so a log of those inputs is a
// complete, replayable description of a run.
//
// Three callers want exactly that, which is why it is one module rather than
// three:
//
//   - **The driver's own client** records as it drives, so it has something to
//     send.
//   - **The opponent's client** replays the stream to draw the other car. It
//     runs the same sim on the same inputs, so the two machines converge by
//     construction rather than by correction.
//   - **The server** replays both logs to decide the round. That is what makes
//     "server authoritative" mean something here: a client can only ever claim
//     *inputs*, and the server decides what those inputs achieved. A client
//     that reports its own finishing time is not being adjudicated, it is being
//     believed.
//
// A log is small. A quarter mile is ~720 ticks but only about thirty events,
// because the throttle is recorded as edges and the gate as the handful of
// directions actually pressed.
