// Engine and drivetrain — pure functions over a plain car-state object.
//
// The drivetrain is treated as locked while the clutch is engaged, so engine rpm
// is *derived* from road speed and gear rather than integrated separately. That
// single choice is what makes the revs drop correctly the instant a shift lands,
// with no separate tuning and no chance of the tachometer disagreeing with the
// physics.
//
// Nothing here touches the DOM, canvas, or wall-clock time. All integration is
// caller-driven with an explicit `dt`, which keeps the sim deterministic and
// leaves the door open for lockstep online play.
