// Shift grading — pure.
//
// Three axes feed one grade:
//
//   1. Timing    — the rpm at the moment the clutch went in sets the ceiling.
//   2. Execution — how fast the gate was worked, and how cleanly, can only
//                  lower that ceiling.
//   3. The catch — picking the gas back up as the clutch bites, which can only
//                  lower it further.
//
// Stated as one rule: the grade is the rpm tier, dropped one step for a slow
// gate, one more for each wall bump, and one or two more for a mistimed catch.
// So bad timing plus a slow shift is a poor shift, perfect timing plus a slow
// shift is merely good, and a lightning gate can never rescue a badly timed one
// — timing is primary, exactly as the design intends.
//
// A snapped gate is rewarded with extra drive force rather than a better grade,
// which keeps the grade honest about timing while still paying for sharp hands.
// Landing in the wrong gear short-circuits everything and is simply `missed`.
//
// **The catch is why a shift is graded in two moments rather than one.** The
// gate resolving decides the gear and the clutch dead time — those happen now
// and cannot wait — but the last input that sets the grade has not been made
// yet. So `resolveShift` returns a *provisional* result and `finaliseShift`
// closes it once the gas is back on (or once it is clear it is not coming).
