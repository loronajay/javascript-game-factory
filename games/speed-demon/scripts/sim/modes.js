// The mode catalog.
//
// One list, read by two very different callers: the mode-select screen draws
// from it, and `createRace` is built from it. That is deliberate — a mode is not
// a branch in the menu code, it is a row here, so adding one is data.
//
// Every mode carries an **objective**: the thing the race is measured against,
// and the thing the setup screen's third pane picks. A distance race is measured
// in metres, a time attack in seconds, and `raceOptionsFor` hands whichever one
// applies straight to `createRace`. Nothing downstream needs to know the mode's
// name to run it, which is what keeps `race.js` free of mode branches.
